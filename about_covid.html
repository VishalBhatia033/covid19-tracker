                SOME FACTS ABOUT VIRUSES
              </h6>
              <p>
                <b>1. </b> Viruses are not alive: They do not have cells, they
                cannot turn food into energy, and without a host they are just
                inert packets of chemicals.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>2. </b> Viruses are not exactly dead, either: They have
                genes, they reproduce, and they evolve through natural
                selection.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>3. </b>Virus comes from the Latin word for “poison” or
                “slimy liquid,” an apt descriptor for the bug that causes flu
                and the common cold.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>4. </b>As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is
                spread through air.

            Coronavirus disease
            <span> COVID-19. </span> is an
            infectious disease caused by the
            <span>SARS-CoV-2 virus.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="m-0 textsizemain">
            Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to
            moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
            treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require
            medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical
            conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
            respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious
            illness. Anyone can get sick with
            <span> COVID-19</span> and
            become seriously ill or die at any age.
          </p>
          <p class="m-0 textsizemain">
            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well
            informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect
            yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre
            apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing
            your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get
            vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance
          </p>
          <p class="m-0 textsizemain">
            The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in
            small liquid particles when they
            <span  >
              cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.</span
            >
            These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller
            aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for
            example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and
            self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.

            Experts believe the virus that causes

            this can happen:

          <ul class="m-0 textsizemain">
            <li>
              <b class="fw-bold"> Droplets or aerosols.</b> This is the most

                coughs, sneezes, or talks,
              </span>
              droplets or tiny particles called aerosols carry the virus
              into the air from their nose or mouth. Anyone who is within 6
              feet of that person can breathe it into their lungs.

            <li>
              <b class="fw-bold">Airborne transmission. </b><span>
                Research shows that the virus can live in the air for up to
                3 hours</span>. It can get into your lungs if someone who has it breathes
              out and you breathe that air in. Experts are divided on how
              often the virus spreads through the airborne route and how
              much it contributes to the pandemic.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b class="fw-bold">Surface transmission. </b> A less common
              method is when you touch surfaces that someone who has the
              virus has coughed or sneezed on. You may touch a countertop or
              doorknob that's contaminated and then touch your nose, mouth,
              or eyes.
              <span>
                The virus can live on surfaces like plastic and stainless
                steel for 2 to 3 days.</span>
              To stop it, clean and disinfect all counters, knobs, and other
              surfaces you and your family touch several times a day.

              <b class="fw-bold">Fecal-oral. </b> Studies also suggest that
              virus particles can be found in infected people's poop. But
              experts aren't sure whether the infection can spread through
              contact with an infected person's stool. If that person uses
              the bathroom and doesn't wash their hands, they could infect
              things and

            vaccines work, it helps to first look at how our bodies fight
            illness. When germs, such as the virus that causes COVID-19,
            invade our bodies, they attack and multiply. This invasion, called
            an infection, is what causes illness. Our immune system uses
            several tools to fight infection. Blood contains red cells, which
            carry oxygen to tissues and organs, and white or immune cells,
            which fight infection. Different types of white blood cells fight
            infection in different ways:

          <ul class="m-0 textsizemain">
            <li>
              <b class="fw-bold">Macrophages</b> are white blood cells that
              swallow up and digest germs and dead or dying cells. The
              macrophages leave behind parts of the invading germs, called
              “antigens”. The body identifies antigens as dangerous and
              stimulates antibodies to attack them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b class="fw-bold">B-lymphocytes</b> are defensive white blood
              cells. They produce antibodies that attack the pieces of the
              virus left behind by the macrophages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b class="fw-bold"> T-lymphocytes</b> are another type of
              defensive white blood cell. They attack cells in the body that
              have already been infected.

            vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes
            COVID-19 without us having to get the illness.

          <p class="m-0 textsizemain">
            Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer
            protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with
            a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that
            will remember how to fight that virus in the future. COVID vaccine
            It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to
            produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes. Therefore, it is possible
            that a person could be infected with the virus that causes
            <span> COVID-19. </span> just
            before or just after vaccination and then get sick because the
            vaccine did not have enough time to provide protection. Sometimes
            after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause
            symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are signs
            that the body is building immunity. Talk to a doctor about taking
            over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen,
            aspirin (only for people age 18 or older), or antihistamines for
            any pain and discomfort experienced after getting vaccinated.
