            <p class="textsizemain">
              Coronaviruses didn't just pop up recently.
              They're a large family of viruses that have been around for a
              long time.

              Many of them can cause a variety of illnesses, from a mild cough
              to severe respiratory illnesses. The new (or “novel”)
              coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of several known to
              infect humans. It's probably been around for some time in
              animals. Sometimes, a virus in animals crosses over into people.
              That's what scientists think happened here. So this virus isn't
              new to the world, but it is new to humans. When scientists found
              out that it was making people sick in 2019, they named it as a
              novel coronavirus. Experts call these strains
              SARS-CoV-2.

              <span class="h6 text-light every_heading">How Do Variants Happen?</span>
            </span>
            <p class="textsizemain">
              Coronaviruses have all their genetic material in something
              called
              <span>RNA (ribonucleic acid). </span>
              RNA has some similarities to DNA, but they aren't the same. When
              viruses infect you, they attach to your cells, get inside them,
              and make copies of their RNA, which helps them spread. If
              there's a copying mistake, the RNA gets changed.
              <span>Scientists call those changes mutations.</span>
              These changes happen randomly and by accident. It's a normal
              part of what happens to viruses as they multiply and spread.
              Because the changes are random, they may make little to no
              difference in a person's health. Other times, they may cause
              disease. For example, one reason you need a flu shot every year
              is because influenza viruses change from year to year. This
              year's flu virus probably isn't the exact same one that
              circulated last year.

              <span class="h6 text-light every_heading">What Is the Omicron Variant?</span>
            </span>
            <p class="textsizemain">
              The new variant<span> (B.1.1.529)</span>
              was first detected in specimens collected on November 11, 2021 in
              Botswana. Experts in South Africa first reported the Omicron
              variant to the World Health Organization (WHO) on Nov. 24, 2021.
              They discovered the variant after COVID-19 infections suddenly
              began to go up. The WHO grouped Omicron as a “Variant of Concern.”
              This category means the variant might have a higher
              transmissibility, cause more intense disease, and may be less
              likely to respond to vaccines or treatments. But researchers need
              more information to confirm these factors. Early evidence suggests
              that the Omicron variant causes a higher risk of reinfection
              compared to other variants.
            </p>
            <p class="textsizemain d-lg-block d-none">
              Current PCR tests for COVID-19 can effectively find Omicron cases.
              Experts found that one specific PCR test doesn't identify one of
              the three target genes (called the S gene dropout) in people
              infected with Omicron. Because of this, these tests can
              specifically mark positive Omicron cases and, because of that, can
              detect this variant faster than with previous surges.
              <span>According to research, breakthrough infections are possible
                with the Omicron variant even if you’re fully vaccinated.
              </span>
              However, COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are still effective at
              preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. The
              Omicron variant is now the dominant strain in the U.S.

            <p class="textsizemain d-lg-block d-none"><b>Omicron “stealth” variant (BA.2):</b> Scientists call it
              <span> Omicron BA.2 </span>as opposed to the original Omicron
              variant, BA.1. At first, scientists thought BA.2 wasn’t as
              contagious as BA.1 and would soon fade away. That didn’t happen,
              and starting in January 2022, BA.2 appeared to be at least as
              easy to transmit as BA.1. As of the end of February 2022, BA.2
              showed signs of spreading more easily than other variants,
              though it didn’t seem to cause more serious symptoms. The World
              Health organization has said that BA.2 is a “variant of
              concern.”

              <b>Alpha (B.1.1.7) . </b> In late 2020, experts noted gene
              mutations in COVID-19 cases seen in people in southeastern
              England. This variant has since been reported in other countries,
              <span>
                including the U.S. Scientists estimate that these mutations
                could make the virus up to 70% more transmissible,
              </span>
              meaning it could spread more easily. Some research has linked this
              variant to a higher risk of death, but the evidence isn't strong.
              The mutation on the Alpha variant is on the spike protein, which
              helps the virus infect its host. This is what COVID-19 vaccines
              target. These vaccines make antibodies against many parts of the
              spike protein, so it's unlikely that a single new mutation in the
              Alpha variant will make the vaccine less effective.

              <b>Mu (B.1.621).</b> Experts first spotted this COVID-19 variant
              (pronounced m'yoo) in Colombia in January 2021. Since then,
              countries in South America and Europe have reported outbreaks of
              Mu. In the U.S., the CDC says Mu reached a peak in June 2021, when
              it made up less than<span>5% </span>
              of variants going around the country. As of early September, it
              had been steadily declining.
            </p>
            <p class="textsizemain">
              <b>R.1.</b> Scientists first detected R.1 in a number of
              countries, including Japan. There was an outbreak at a Kentucky
              nursing home in March 2021, when an unvaccinated health care
              worker passed it to about 45 other staff and residents. The WHO
              labeled it a “variant under monitoring” in April 2021, meaning
              some of its characteristics may pose a future risk to humans. As
              of October 2021, the CDC hadn't labeled R.1 as a variant of
              concern or interest. Epsilon, Theta, and Zeta were at one point
              listed as variants of interest and were downgraded by the WHO.
              They are still being monitored.

              The virus that causes COVID-19 will probably keep changing.
              Experts may find new variants. It's impossible to predict how
              those virus changes might affect what happens. But change is just
              what viruses do.
